This project was developed as part of the Qiskit Fall Fest PNC 2025. It aims to apply the learned skills to the real world problems.


The project titled “Quantum Random Number Generator” are essentials for computing, especially in security and cryptography. Classical random generators rely on deterministic algorithms but quantum random number generators rely on quantum superposition and measurement to produce truly random outcomes. QRNG is unbiased and is more secured than classical random number generator.


This project uses Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) to show how quantum mechanics is used in the field like cryptography and security. 

I have used Hadamard(H) gates to create a superposition. There is a equal probability of both 0 and 1 when measured, which yields a uniform random distribution of 2^n. This randomness is fundamentally quantum and cannot be predicted or reproduced.

Since I have used Statevector-based QRNG and QASM-based QRNG, the output produced by each is different which can be used to demonstrate multiple independent samples. The circuit diagram is used for clear visualization. I have also used statistical tools which proves that the distribution is close to uniform.

Overall, this project demonstrates: Quantum randomness, superposition, measurement, qubits, circuit creation-simulation-visualization, statistical proof of quantum randomness.
